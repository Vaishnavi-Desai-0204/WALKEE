Walkee is a productivity app built for iOS using Swift in Xcode. The app calculates daily steps and rewards users with virtual trees that they can add to their virtual forest when they reach a certain step count. The steps are tracked using the HealthKit feature and can be viewed in the home view.

Upon opening the app, users are greeted with an onboarding view that provides a brief introduction to the app and its features. To use the app, users must grant permission to access their HealthKit data.

When a user earns a virtual tree, it is added to their inventory and can be dragged and dropped into different cells in their virtual forest. The virtual forest is implemented using the SceneKit feature, which allows users to view and interact with their trees in a three-dimensional environment.

Users can share their virtual forest with friends through iCloud, and statistics about daily and weekly steps are displayed in the statistics view.

Walkee was created as a submission for the ACM Hackathon Spring 2022 at UNR, and the project won first prize in the mobile app category. The app was inspired by popular productivity and wellness apps such as Sweatcoin and Forest.
